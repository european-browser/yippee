Verso is a web browser built on top of Servo web engine. It's still under development. We dont' accept any feature request at the moment.
But if you are interested, feel free to help test it.

# Usage

The current demo works best on macOS at the moment, since it tries to customize its traffic light buttons to be seamless in the window.

However, We plan to focus on Windows as main target support.

## Prerequisites

### Windows

- Install [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and then install other tools:

```sh
scoop install git python llvm cmake curl
```

### MacOS

- Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then install other tools:

```sh
brew install cmake pkg-config harfbuzz
```

### Linux

#### Debian-based Distributions

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential python3-pip ccache clang cmake curl \
g++ git gperf libdbus-1-dev libfreetype6-dev libgl1-mesa-dri \
libgles2-mesa-dev libglib2.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \

For others, please follow the instructions in [Servo book](https://book.servo.org/hacking/setting-up-your-environment.html#tools-for-linux) to bootstrap first.

## Build

- Run demo

```sh
cargo run
```

## Nightly Release

Nightly releases built with CrabNebula Cloud can be found at [releases](https://web.crabnebula.cloud/verso/verso-nightly/releases).

## Future Work

- Add more window and servo features to make it feel more like a general web browser.
- Improve development experience.
- Multi webviews and multi browsing contexts in the same window.
- Enable `Gstreamer` feature and remove `brew install harfbuzz` in README.
